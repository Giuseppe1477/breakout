# Brick-Breaker

## Game Intro
This is a simple introductory program to learning graphics in java. 
It is the basic game of brickbreaker/breakout using an updating screen
and simple draw functions. The game is simple where you control a 
paddle on the bottom of the screen and try to bounce the ball to hit
the bricks layered above. The ball moves at a random speed at a random angle
whenever the ball makes contact with the paddle

## The Controls
The controls are simple, you use the left (←) and right (→) arrow
keys to control the paddle. Then, when you complete the game
or let the ball past the paddle, press (E) to exit or (R) to replay the game

## The Rules
When you start the game, to earn points you have to make the ball hit the
bricks using the paddle at the bottom of the screen. You only get one life
so make sure to stay alert. The goal is 450pts to win or all the bricks
